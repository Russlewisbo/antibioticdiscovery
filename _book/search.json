    "text": "1 Preface\nThis is the website for the 1st Edition of “Antibiotic Therapy: Discovery, Development and Rationale Clinical Use.” This book will help you learn about the science of antibiotic therapy and resistance, and how antibiotics are classically discovered, refined, developed for clinical use and (hopefully) effectively used in patients. You’ll learn why antibiotic discovery is difficult, and why our lack of novel antibiotic development is contributing to perhaps the most important crises in public health and medicine-antibiotic resistance.\nIn this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data.\nThis website is and will always be free, licensed under the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 License.

    "text": "3.1 Antibiotic prehistory\nThe beginning of antibiotic discovery is often linked to the screening of chemical dyes for selective antimicrobial activity by Paul Erlichin. Erlich’s efforts lead to the discovery of compound #606 (Salvarsan) in 1909, the first effective teatment for syphilis. Erlich’s discovery was later followed by Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin isolated from the mold Penicllim notum in 1928. These discoveries defined the two major branches of antibiotic discovery- screening of synthestic compounds and screening of natural products. Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages but have resulted in teh discovery of a number of clinically-useful antibiotics.\nHowever, naturally-available treatments, including herbs, honey and moldy bread had been used for centuries as topical antimicrobial therapies in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, Serbia, Greece and Rome.1 Tetracycline antibiotics have been detected in skeletons of the Sudanese Nubians from the time of Roman occupation, despite the fact that this class of antibiotics was not technically “discovered” until 1945.2 A chemical analysis of the skeletons in 2010 subsequently confirmed that the ancient Nubians were likely exposed to “therapeutic” antibiotic concentrations from routine ingestion of special beer they produced Figure 3.1 that contained fermentation byproducts of Actinomycetes spp.3\nBy 1640, the benefits of using mould extracts for treating infected would was described by the herbalist and apothecary John Parkison in his book Theatrum botanicum Figure 3.2. However, what was missing is the concept of microorganisms as a cause of infection or the Germ Theory of Disease, which would take another 250 years. Therefore, therapeutic use of antibiotics, as considered in the modern sense, did not occur until after the discovery and description of bacteria.",
