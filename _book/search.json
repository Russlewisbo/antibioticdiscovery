    "text": "1 Preface\nThis is the website for the 2nd edition of “R for Data Science”. This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it and visualize.\nIn this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data.\nThis website is and will always be free, licensed under the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 License. If you’d like a physical copy of the book, you can order it on Amazon.

    "text": "3.1 Antibiotic prehistory\nThe origin of the modern antibiotic therapy is often linked to Paul Erlich’s discovery of arsphenamine (Salvarsan) in 1909 followed by Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928.\nHowever, there is considerable evidence that naturally-available treatments, including herbs, honey and mouldy bread had been used for centuries as topical antimicrobial therapies in ancient Egypt, China, Serbia, Greece and Rome.1\nEven “modern” antibiotics may have been available in ancient times. Traces of tetracyclines have been detected in human skeletons recovered Sudanese Nubiansfrom the time of Roman occupation of Egypt despite the fact that this class of antibiotics was not technically “discovered” in the modern era until 1945.2Chemical analysis suggests they were ingesting the antibiotic tetracycline on a regular basis, likely from a special brew of beer3.\nThe benefits of using mould extracts were already well-documented by the herbalist and apothecary John Parkison in his book Theatrum botanicum. published in 1640.",
