# Origins of antibiotic therapy

## Antibiotic prehistory

Many textbooks consider Paul Erlich's discovery of arsphenamine (Salvarsan) in 1909 followed by Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928 the beginning of the modern antibiotic era.

However, naturally-available treatments, including herbs, honey and mouldy bread had been used for centuries as topical antimicrobial therapies in ancient Egypt, China, Serbia, Greece and Rome.[@gould2016] Tetracycline antibiotics have even ben detected in human skeletons of the Sudanese Nubians from the time of Roman occupation, despite the fact that this class of antibiotics was not technically "discovered" until 1945. [@Bassett1980] A chemical analysis of the skeletons subsequently confirmed that the ancient Nubians were likely exposed to "therapeutic" antibiotic concentrations from routine ingestion of special beer they produced that contained fermentation byproducts of *Actinomycetes* spp. [@nelson.etal_2010a]

By 1640, the benefits of using mould extracts for treating infected would was described by the herbalist and apothecary John Parkison in his book *Theatrum botanicum.* However, what was missing is the concept of microorganisms as a cause of infection or the *Germ Theory of Disease,* which would take another XX years. Therefore,
